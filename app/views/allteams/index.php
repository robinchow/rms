        <img src="http://www.cserevue.org.au/img/logo.png" alt=""><h1>CSE Revue</h1>
        <p class="lead">The Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) Revue is a live comedy sketch show held during September at the University of New South Wales (UNSW). Produced and directed by members of the society, the show serves to highlight the technical and creative talents of UNSW students, as well as an opportunity for students to further develop their university experience.</p>
      </div>

    <div class="cover-pic" id="one"></div>
    <div class="page" id="tech">
      <div class="container">
        <h1>Tech</h1>
        <p>The Tech team construct the props and the sets for the show, from massive spinning fans, to doors and giant pieces of a monopoly set. During the show Techies operate lights and sound, run around like cockroaches setting the stage and play with the fog machine.</p>
        <p>The only skills necessary are a good appreciation of teamwork and enjoyment of hanging around with others. If you have any experience with lighting, sound, set construction and related skills you'd be a particularly welcome member of the team. Tech consumes about 8 hours a week for the six weeks before show, and up to every show night depending on your interest. But hey, paint doesn't dry very well in the dark, so they'll knock off at sun down and hit the pub.</p>
        <p>Tech is a great place to pick up some fantastic skills, working in the dark with a team of people, potentially making  split-second decisions which directly effect the show each night. You'll learn some painting and construction alongside the in's and outs of theatre. Although you might not operate a light/sound/video console for your first show you'll have the opportunity to watch and assist others in this task.</p>

        <h1>Band</h1>
        <p>The band are the masters of sound and music. As a member you will be part of the atmosphere and intrigue surrounding dances and skits. The band is also given time to shine in the illustrious band number - a highlight of any revue. They also have a great time, with a reputation for partying harder and faster than any that have come before.</p>
        <p>Band puts in a dozen or so rehearsals and the four performance nights in session 2. Outside of that, the band is always looking for ways to avoid work, chill, and jam the night away. If you are an aspiring band member then you will need to bring your own instrument along with the best musical talent you can muster.</p>

        <p>The cast are made up of the actors, singers, and dancers (often all rolled into one) who perform on stage (and in videos) for the show. The cast are charged with power! The power to make the audience laugh, cheer, and lose control of their bowels every night.</p>
        <p>Being a member of cast requires a massive commitment, Life becomes an intense blur of rehearsals, promotions, and performing, with Directors poking you the whole way along (don't ask with what).</p>
        <p>BUT! Being in cast is also arguably the most rewarding and exciting thing that you will ever do with your life ever! Making hundreds of people laugh, getting to spend 3 months with a bunch of awesome people, making friends that will last a lifetime, and making a very special contribution to this crazy ol thing we call CSE Revue.</p>
        <p>Sounds like something you want to do? The wonderful thing about revue is to be in cast NO EXPERIENCE IS REQUIRED! You don't have to be the loudest or funniest person in the world either, we'll teach you all the wicked skills you'll need. All we need from you is your dedication, enthusiasm, and luurve.</p>

        <p>The Costumes team is responsible for adding that extra li'l oomph on stage, making the cast look their sparkly best, for dressing up the Promotions team with costumes to make people turn and stare, and of course having awesome fun making the rest of Revue look so damn good (oh yeah)! Costumes is a great team to join for helping out behind the scenes with the added bonus that you get to see the products of your creation on stage!</p>
        <p>It doesn't matter if you don't know how to sew. CSE's Costumes Team is a great place for learning some fundamental aspects of theatre costume design, practicing sewing skills, recapturing your youth and going back to those days of glitter-glue and finger-painting.</p>
        <p>If you have a bit of creative flair for designing eye-catching costumes, a weakness for the (oh so sexy) rev of those sewing machines, are an absolute artiste! with a pair of scissors in hand or are just interested in learning and creating things that will turn up on stage then Costumes is the team for you.</p>

        <h1>VFX</h1>
        <p>Take a moment in time when you giggle profusely at something very silly. What would happen when if you were to replay that moment, over and over again? Slower and faster? Backwards and forwards? And what would happen when a group of mates were sitting around, reveling in the silliness, falling over each other laughing like hyenas?</p>
        <p>What you've just read is a description of scrubbing, just one of hundreds of tools available to you as an editor. And editing is just one part of making videos, each as fun as the last. There's storyboarding, shooting, animation, compositing, colour correction and more.</p>
        <p>The VFX team takes ideas and scripts that are too hard to do on stage (or can be done much better through a lens) and uses professional equipment to make them come to life on the screen.</p>
        <p>We'll teach you everything you need to know about film making, but if you're a photographer, 3D animator or if you've just seen far too many movies, we'd love to have you on board.</p>

        <h1>Wellbeing</h1>
        <p>Wellbeing is all about food and health!</p>
        <p>Delicious, life nurturing food and general health.</p>
        <p>As a member of the kind Wellbeing team, you'll be looking after the cast and crew involved in the show by assisting a team to cook for forty humans! hahaha, just kidding. Try a hundred and forty.</p>
        <p>Don't think you'll need cooking talents in any sense (but if you have them - awesome! you can teach us a thing or two).</p>
        <p>We guarantee a hilarious time experimenting with recipes, watching kitchens being reduced to ashes, and having a celebratory shingdig when something edible happens to pop out of the stove!</p>
        <p>All we need is a few of your hours in the evening whenever you can spare them, whether you're going dice happy with the meat and vege, teaching/learning a new recipe, or if you think moral support's your strong suit.</p>
        <p>Wellbeing's also one of the more casual teams in terms of time commitment, so help out on any nights that you'd like. But you should know, the more often you appear through the doors, carrying hot, mouth watering food, the more everyone involved in the show will love you.</p>
        <p>Don't think that we only cook during Show and Production Weeks!</p>
        <p>We also have social Cooking sessions, and the occassional Cooking class, but most of all, we also look after camp! But it's not as if you're there to cook for everyone, you'll be at camp not only for the social activities, but also as a team member that facilitates Revue campers cook everyones meals on a rotational basis.</p>

        <p>Once the show is surrounded by the lights, sounds, sets and props that Tech provide, it grows to a whole new level. The Special FX team take this one step further, by providing special technical costumes, technical props and generally making things look cool.</p>
        <p>If you can wield a soldering iron with the precision of a surgeon or can put together electrical circuits in the blink of an eye, or if you want to learn how to do these sorts of things, then this is the team for you.</p>
        <p>As Computing and Engineering students, CSE Revue has a reputation to uphold for making things light up, get dark or just go boom and as a member of the Special FX team, you'll be working to make this reputation better than ever. We can teach all the skills required, so if you're new to making things but would like to be involved you're welcome.</p>

        <h1>Design and Publications</h1>
          <p>Since 2014, the Design team and Publications team have been merged to create an <b>Ultimate Unit</b> proficient enough to handle the challenges thrown our way. As members of the Dubs team, we specialise in designing and producing creative content for CSE Revue.</p>
          <p>Our main responsibilities include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Keeping track of what's going on in the society (and making sure that <i>everyone knows</i> of what’s going on in the society)</li>
            <li>Planning/ producing programmes and newsletters</li>
            <li>Producing promotional products</li>
            <li>Designing websites, T-shirts, stage set, etc.</li>
            <li>Helping promote CSE’s image to present to <i>the world</i> (ie. our members, audience, sponsors, and many random passers-by)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>To join, you <b><i>do not</i></b> need prior skills or experience (although they are most welcome). Having an artistic edge is always a plus, but you'll learn how to use the tools of the trade, along with some theory behind effective visual design, throughout the year.</p>
          <p>So if you’re one to draw and design graphics, document memorable events (either by writing about it, or photographing on the day), or simply just see your ideas come to life, then you’re perfect for the job! We would like to invite you on board to take part in some of the innovative makings of CSE Revue.</p>

        <p>Front of House (a.k.a FoH) is all about keeping the audience happy. FoH make sure they are entertained before the show begins, provide them with food and drink, give them a band to listen to and show them to their seats. FoH ensure the audience come away from an enjoyable experience all around. FoH members enjoy socialising, talking and making people happy. FoH also attracts people with an eye for detail - the decorators among you will be responsible for the theatre decorations.</p>
        <p>The Front of House Team will also be involved in filling the showbags we give to our audience with goodies. This means finding cool free things to hand out...everyone loves free stuff!</p>
        <p>You can also join other teams that don't operate during show nights - that means being part of the whole CSE Revue experience without giving your time entirely to one team. And the big bonus? The chance to see the show for free. Yes, that's right, free!</p>
